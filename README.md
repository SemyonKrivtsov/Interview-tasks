## List Childs

<em>Task description:</em>

Design a screen where the person can fill in information about themselves and their children.
Above there should be fields for entering the name and age of the user.
Information about children should be entered below. Initially, the user sees only the "+" button, when you click on it, a block appears in which you can enter information about the child: Name and age. Thus, the user can add up to 5 children. When the user has added 5 children, the "+" button disappears and is no longer available. Also, opposite each child there is a "delete" button, by clicking on which the corresponding record is deleted.
